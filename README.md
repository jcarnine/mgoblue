What if I want to center this text?...Joes says it's just a simple tool and text is only left-justified....

How about adding some inline math?
$$
8+3y=17 \\
3y=9 \\
y=3
$$
â€‹	Solve for x:
$$
x^2+3x-37=43
$$

Conclusion:  Inline math doesn't appear the same once committed as it does when viewing it in Typora?  Why?  Do we care?  (Probably won't ever use it...)
