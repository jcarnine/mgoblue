# Introduction

Can I create a readme.md from Typora and Desktop?

â€‹	**Yes, I can!**



To add a folder to the respository on GitHub you can create local folder in your repository and create a README file with it.  When you publish your local repository back to GitHub, the folder and subsequent README will the be added (and you can merge back to master later)
